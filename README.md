Web controller for Argos system, providing flexible and dynamic control to the system

**Warning: the webpage is written only to support Chrome. It has errors on Firefox but I don't fix it.**

## Dependencies

This project is **only** for [Skylark Wireless](http://www.skylarkwireless.com/) Iris board, the GitHub site is [here](https://github.com/skylarkwireless)

The SoapyIris dependency could be installed use this script: [install_soapy.sh](https://github.com/skylarkwireless/sklk-soapyiris/blob/master/utils/install_soapy.sh)



You need to install python3.x on your computer, then run command

```shell
python3 -m pip install -r requirement.txt
```

Then you can run `host.py` to start the web server

```shell
python3 host.py
```

it will then print the port information, which by default is `0.0.0.0:8080` public to other computer if your firewall allows. If you want to use it locally, run with argument

```shell
python3 host.py --host="127.0.0.1" --port=80
```

then you can visit the GUI by `http://localhost/` in browser
